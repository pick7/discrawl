# Releasing `discrawl`

Always do all steps below. No partial releases.

Assumptions:
- Repo: `openclaw/discrawl`
- Binary: `discrawl`
- GoReleaser config: `.goreleaser.yaml`
- Homebrew tap repo: `~/Projects/homebrew-tap`
- Official releases run from macOS through the shared managed-keychain helper

## 0) Prereqs

- Clean working tree on `main`
- Go toolchain from `go.mod`
- GitHub CLI authenticated
- CI green on `main`
- OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID Application identity available through the managed release keychain

## 1) Verify build + tests

```sh
go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.12.2 run
go test -count=1 ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -n 1
go test -count=1 -race ./...
go build -o /tmp/discrawl ./cmd/discrawl
gh run list -L 5 --branch main
```

Coverage floor: `85%+`

## 2) Finalize changelog and release notes

Replace the current `Unreleased` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` with the release
version and date. Use that exact section as the GitHub Release body and append a
link to the full changelog at the tagged commit.

Example:

- `## 0.2.0 - 2026-03-08`

## 3) Commit, tag, push

```sh
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git commit -am "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
git tag -v vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

## 4) Publish signed release artifacts

From the clean checkout whose `HEAD` exactly matches the signed tag, publish all
GoReleaser artifacts through the shared secret-safe keychain helper:

```sh
./scripts/release-signed.sh vX.Y.Z
```

The script uses an existing GitHub token environment variable or the
authenticated GitHub CLI without writing credentials to disk.

The GoReleaser hook signs only the two macOS binaries. Snapshot builds and all
non-macOS targets remain credential-free. Production builds fail closed unless
the macOS artifacts use identifier `org.openclaw.discrawl` and OpenClaw
Foundation Team ID `FWJYW4S8P8`.

Publishing the GitHub Release triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
downloads both macOS archives on native runners, verifies their checksums and
Developer ID signatures, then dispatches the Homebrew update.

## 5) Verify GitHub Release

```sh
gh run list -L 5 --workflow release.yml
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json url,body,assets
```

Before closeout, confirm the Release body contains the exact `X.Y.Z`
changelog section and a full-changelog link. If it is missing or stale, prepare
the corrected body in a reviewed file and run:

```sh
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file /tmp/discrawl-release-notes.md
```

Confirm checksums plus assets exist for:

- `darwin_amd64`
- `darwin_arm64`
- `linux_amd64`
- `linux_arm64`
- `windows_amd64`
- `windows_arm64`

## 6) Verify Homebrew tap update

`discrawl` ships a binary formula in `~/Projects/homebrew-tap/Formula/discrawl.rb` that points at the GitHub release archives.

The release workflow dispatches `openclaw/homebrew-tap`'s
`update-formula.yml` and waits for it to finish. Verify the formula version and
per-platform checksums landed, then test the installed binary. Do not manually
duplicate a successful automated update.

Useful commands:

```sh
curl -L -o /tmp/discrawl-darwin-arm64.tgz https://github.com/openclaw/discrawl/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/discrawl_X.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
shasum -a 256 /tmp/discrawl-darwin-arm64.tgz
brew uninstall discrawl || true
brew install openclaw/tap/discrawl
discrawl --version
brew info openclaw/tap/discrawl
```

## 7) Close out the release

Only after the GitHub Release, release notes, assets, and Homebrew formula are
verified, add the next patch section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`. For example,
after `0.11.4`:

- `## 0.11.5 - Unreleased`

Commit that closeout with a conventional `chore:` message and push `main`.

## Notes

- Build-time version stamping comes from `-X github.com/openclaw/discrawl/internal/cli.version={{ .Version }}`
- If release workflow needs a rerun:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```
